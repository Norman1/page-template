## How It Works

The template is built using Web Components, which means each part of the page (header, navigation, content area, etc.) is a self-contained component with its own styling and functionality. This makes the template incredibly flexible and easy to maintain.

### Component-Based Design
Each section of your website is a separate component:
- Site header with branding and authentication
- Navigation sidebar for main site navigation
- Content area for your main page content
- Optional right sidebar for additional navigation or widgets
- Footer for site information

### Holy Grail Layout
The template uses the classic "Holy Grail" layout pattern that web developers have been perfecting for decades:
- Header and footer span the full width
- Content area is flanked by sidebars
- Everything scales beautifully from mobile to desktop
- Navigation becomes mobile-friendly automatically
